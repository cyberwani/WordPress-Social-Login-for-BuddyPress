Wordpress social login hacked/fixed to work with BuddyPress.
------------------------------------------------------------

I did not create this plugin, all i did was:

1) Made it work correctly with Buddypress

2) Fixed an issue where social imported images would overwite a profile image that a user had uploaded.

The plugin author can be found here:

This plugin is based of the version 2.1.3 which can be located here
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-social-login/developers/

Hopefully the author will implement these changes
